Idea: have a chat where you can only use words that have not already been used. And when you try to type a word already used it will say something like "User X has already said that word."

Features:
* Choose a name
* Write something in the chat
* Regularly update the chat
* Don't allow words already used

Technologies:  
Front-end: 
* Just a simple React website

Back-end:
* Flask for API
* MySQL db or maybe even a NoSQL DB like MongoDB/ ElasticSearch.
